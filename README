This is a simple script written in Python for downloading a YouTube playlist to a local folder, and keeping it in sync.
It uses youtube-dl (https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) by Ricardo Garcia and many more - thanks for a great tool!

Usage: playlist-crawler.py [url] [path]
        url:    can be video or playlist, default 'YouTube Top 100 Electronica playlist'
        path:   Where to store downloaded videos, default: '/home/{username}/Electronica'

Both default variables are configurable, can be edited at the top of the file - enjoy!
